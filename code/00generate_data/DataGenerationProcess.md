# Process to generate ADRD study population

## Extract ADRD admission info from hospitalization files

[`01extractADRDhospital.R`](https://github.com/ShuxinD/airPollution_ADRD/blob/main/code/00generate_data/01extractADRDhospital.R)

- Select ADRD diagnosis based on ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes using in the paper [**Using Medicare claims in identifying Alzheimerâ€™s disease and related dementias**](https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.12199); codes are modified from [a previous one](https://github.com/NSAPH/data_requests/blob/master/request_projects/jan2021_whanhee_fisrt_hosps/code/2_id_hospitalizations.R).
- Export several `.fst` files named as `ADRD'type'_'year'.fst`, e.g. `ADRDprimary_2000.fst`

## Generate ADRD study population ID and admission info

[`02getEnrolledInfo.R`](https://github.com/ShuxinD/airPollution_ADRD/blob/main/code/00generate_data/02getEnrolledInfo.R)

- Combine `.fst` files exported from the previous step, check duplicates
- Export `EnrolledInfo.csv`, only containing `QID` and `firstADRDyr`

## Extract the denominator files for ADRD population 

[`03extractDenominatorFile.R`]()

- Subset the denominator files to those with `QID` which appeared in `EnrolledInfo.csv`

- For each `QID`, subset the person-year row data to those after `firstADRDyr ` (`year>=firstADRDyr`), based on `EnrolledInfo.csv`
- Remove duplicates, export `ADRDpopulation.csv`

## Check the completeness of follow-up
